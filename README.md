# Smart Farm Biosecurity Platform for Poultry & Pig Farmers

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is an **AI-powered digital platform** designed to empower poultry and pig farmers with tools to **maintain biosecurity, prevent disease outbreaks, and improve farm productivity**. It connects **farmers, veterinarians, and government authorities** to streamline farm monitoring, vaccination compliance, training, and market access.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Enhance farmer awareness about biosecurity practices.
- Improve disease prevention through AI-assisted alerts and vaccination tracking.
- Reward farmers for compliance and training through a points-based system.
- Provide veterinarians and government officers with real-time farm monitoring dashboards.
- Facilitate better market access for top-performing farmers.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Farmer logs in** → selects farm type → completes training modules.  
2. **Points awarded** based on training, hygiene, and vaccination compliance.  
3. **Vaccination calendar** sends reminders → farmer marks vaccinations.  
4. **Vet visits** → verifies health data, updates records.  
5. **Leaderboard updates** → top farmers get market insights and premium access.  
6. **Government dashboard** monitors compliance, outbreaks, and vaccination stats.
